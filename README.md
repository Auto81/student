# Cucumber School Student Guide

A tool for helping students download the code for each [Cucumber School](https://school.cucumber.io ) lesson, so you can easily follow along with the videos.

Try it out:

```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cucumber-school/student/a7196c847180784405b6f764e26331b4542a1724/cucumber-school)
